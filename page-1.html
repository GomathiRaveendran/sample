      <p> Welcome to my (kinda) informal portfolio! I am a first year Computer Science Undergraduate student at
         Amrita Viswa Vidhyapeetham. On most days you can find me holed up in one corner of the library.
         I absolutely love books. When I have free time, I spend it mostly on writing poetry in my blog
         (Check it out in the Social Media section!), reading books and learning new things like front-end development.
        <br>Fun-fact: I learnt JavaScript a day before creating this webpage.
      </p>
      <p>Having been born and brought up in Chennai, I sometimes miss the dirty, crowded and busy streets of my hometown when I am at college. I have learnt a lot about myself while living at hostel, and I'm quite excited to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>This portfolio may seem a bit incomplete and pointless. I took it as a challenge to build a decent enough webpage with proper responsive design, enhancements and accessibility within two days. This will -obviously- still require a lot improvement.
      Feel free to look around and let me know what you think, through any of my social media accounts.<br><br>
        &nbsp; Cheers!
